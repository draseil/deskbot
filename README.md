deskbot
-------

Started as a desktop bot. I'm trying to make it as complete as spoonbot, then work from there.

Check the wiki for a list of commands and how to make your own.

To start the bot:
```
python deskbot.py server [-p 'password'] [-b 'botnick'] [-a 'admin_nick']
```

Note: be sure to place the server there if you'll be using the flags.

Note 2: brackets shouldn't be there, they're just to say "optional".

Note 3: the bot will pick up the first argument for the server, so...

Note 4: I can't into flags, I'm sorry. ;-;
