deskbot
-------

\#rice's desktop bot. (At least for now.)

I'd list the commands and usage here, but if you really want to know, just check .help, come on.

To start the bot:
```
python deskbot.py server [-p 'password'] [-b 'botnick'] [-a 'admin_nick']
```

Note: be sure to place the server there if you'll be using the flags.
Note 2: [] shouldn't be there, they're just to say "optional".
Note 3: the bot will pick up the first argument for the server, so...
Note 4: I can't into flags, I'm sorry. ;-;
